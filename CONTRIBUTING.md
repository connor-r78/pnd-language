## Project Code Style
1. **Namings** must be clear and understandable. <br/>
_Variables/Functions_ use `snake_case`, and for public versions prepend the header it is defined in (for types (excluding structures) `_t` at the end: `token_t`). <br/>
_Structs/Unions/Enums_ use `PascalCase`
_Defined Constants_ (`#define`) should have `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`. <br/>
_Other Constants_ should have prefix `k`. <br/>
3. **Includes** are located at the start, _standard library headers_ must be separated from _user header files_.
4. **Repeating** code suggested to be in separated function.
5. **No Magic Numbers**. If you need to use that number, declare a constant with it.
6. **Comments** should be minimal and helpful. Please do not leave a comment saying \"_foo_ gets set to _7_\" <br/>
Always leave necessary documentation for provided API and changes.
7. **The code blocks** should not be "glued together", they should be separated according to their logical meaning. AKA put line breaks after loops, group variables, etc.
8. **Header Guard** should follow next syntax: `PROJECTNAME_[SUBDIRS_]MODULENAME_H_`
   - `PROJECTNAME` - uppercase project name (here `PND`)
   - `SUBDIRS` - optional nested directories
   - `MODULENAME` - uppercase module name
   - Suffix `H` is mandatory
